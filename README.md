corpus.txt should be downloaded from here:

ML libraries have been disabled for the competition, hence only using standard Python imports.

It turns out N=92 (there are 92 tests): I have scored 17.39, 18.48 and 19.57 and N=92 is the only integer such that score = 50 * Max(C-W,0)/N results integer values of (C-W) in each case.

My currently (extremely naive) algorithm gets 64/92 correct. Must do better!
